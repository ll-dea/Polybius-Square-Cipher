-- Faculty of Electric and Computer Engineering
--- Project topic: Encryption and decryption with Polybius Square Cipher
--- Students that has contributed: Dea Llapatinca, Dion Gashi, Diell Do√ßi dhe Dion Bogaj
--- Supervisor: Prof Blerim Rexha dhe Ass. Mergim Hoti
--Project Description:
The idea behind this project is to implement a Python program for encoding and decoding messages using the Polybius Square Cipher. The Polybius Square Cipher is a simple substitution cipher that replaces each letter in the plaintext with a pair of numbers representing its coordinates in a grid. 
---How to Use:
----To use this program on your device, follow these steps:
----Clone or Download the Repository: Begin by downloading or cloning the repository containing the Python script.
----Install Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your device. This program is compatible with Python 3.
----Run the Program: Navigate to the directory where the Python script is located using the command line or terminal. Then, run the script by executing the command python polybius_cipher.py.
----Choose Operation: Upon running the program, you'll be prompted to choose between encoding and decoding options. Type 'encode' if you want to encode a message or 'decode' if you want to decode a message.
----Input Message: Depending on your choice, input the message you want to encode or decode when prompted.
----View Results: The program will then display the encoded or decoded message based on your input.
---Configuration Requirements:
----No special configurations are needed to run this program. As long as you have Python installed on your device, you should be able to execute the script without any additional setup. Simply follow the instructions provided above to use the program on your device.What are results of your project, what other expect to generate your project?
