# Polybius Square Cipher

## Project Description

This project, developed by Dea Llapatinca, Dion Gashi, Dion Bogaj and Diell Do√ßi from the University of Prishtina "Hasan Prishtina" under the supervision of Prof Blerim Rexha and Ass. Mergim Hoti, focuses on implementing a Python program for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Polybius Square Cipher. The Polybius Square Cipher is a simple substitution cipher that replaces each letter in the plaintext with a pair of numbers representing its coordinates in a grid.


## Configuration Requirements

No special configurations are needed to run this program. As long as you have Python installed on your device, you should be able to execute the script without any additional setup. Simply follow the instructions provided above to use the program on your device.

## Expected Results

The expected result of this project is a fully functional Python program that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Polybius Square Cipher. Users can expect a user-friendly interface.
